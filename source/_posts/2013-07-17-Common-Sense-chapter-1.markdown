### OF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL,WITH CONCISE REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION

### 常规的政府起源和设计，兼简评英国制度

<!--more-->

SOME writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only different,but have different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by wickedness; the former promotes our happiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions. The first is a patron, the last a punisher.

__一些__ 写小册子（发表政治见解）的人混淆社会和政府的区别，认为二者区别很小或者没有区别。二者不仅不同，连起源都不同。社会起源于人的需求，而政府起源于人的邪恶。

writers：当时美洲流行写小册子发表政治见解。这里的writers就是当时写小册子的那些人。本书也是当时的一个小册子。

Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is
but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we
suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which
we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is
heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.
Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings
are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of
conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no
other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to
surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the
rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other
case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. WHEREFORE,
security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably
follows that whatever FORM thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us,
with the least expence and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.
